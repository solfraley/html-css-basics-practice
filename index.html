	<h1>Demonstration</h1>
	<p>Here is simple html page with the purpose of demonstrating and practicing some
		basic website building competencies.  My intention here is simply to put up some
		material to get familiar with the process of putting up content.  I will add, change and build simply for practice.  Essentially all of this 
		project may simple be viewed as a series of place holders, for expedience sake.</p>

	<h3>Additions and Things</h3>
	<p>A side note: I've included jquery, json2 underscore and backbone, at this point for test practice in the console.</p>
	<p>---Here I would like to add some thoughts and ideas about coding that may be helpful to others or simply as notes----</p>
	<p>My intention is put down a very quick and basic structure that I can then add
		elements and funtionality.  Quick basic and easy is the intention, nothing mind 
		bending</p>

	<h3>Links</h3>
